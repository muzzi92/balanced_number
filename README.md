# Balanced Number Checker #

This exercise was taken from a [kata](https://www.codewars.com/kata/5a4e3782880385ba68000018).

The challenge reads as follows:

> Given an number , find whether the given number is a balanced number. A balanced number is one such that the sum of all digits to the left of the middle digit(s) and the sum of all digits to the right of the middle digit(s) are equal. If the number has an odd number of digits then there is only one middle digit, e.g. 92645 has middle digit 6; otherwise, there are two middle digits, e.g. 1301 has middle digits 3 and 0. The middle digit(s) should not be considered when determining whether a number is balanced or not, e.g. 413023 is a balanced number because the left sum and right sum are both 5.

> Our kata is simple , given a positive number determine whether the number is balanced, returning the result as a string.

I have built a method to satisfy these specifications, using Test Driven Development.
